Task 2:-

Subject: Request for Time Extension for Project Due For 6th February 2023

Dear Account Manager,

  I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. 
I am writing to you to request an extension of time for the project which is due tomorrow. Due to a family emergency, 
I am unable to complete the project within the given deadline.

  As much as I have tried to work on the project within the given time frame, 
I have found myself unable to do so.
My family emergency has taken up a lot of my time and energy and I am unable to meet the deadline. 
I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, 
but I am left with no other choice but to request an extension.

  I am hoping that you could grant me an extension of three days to complete the project. 
This will give me enough time to finish the project to the best of my ability. 
I am fully committed to completing the project to a high standard and 
I hope that you can understand the circumstances I am facing.

  I would be happy to discuss this matter further with you if you have any questions or concerns. 
I would like to thank you for your understanding and I hope that this request for extension can be granted.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

        Sameer Ajay Harankhedkar            üìç    Amravati, Maharashtra
